# MNIST-Classification-using-MLP
Multi-Layer Perceptron is used to classify images from the MNIST database hand-written digit database using PyTorch.

The MNIST database (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems. The database is also widely used for training and testing in the field of machine learning.

The process will be broken down into the following steps:
- Load and visualize the data
- Define a neural network
- Train the model
- Evaluate the performance of our trained model on a test dataset!
