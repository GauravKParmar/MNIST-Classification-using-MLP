# MNIST-Classification-using-MLP
Multi-Layer Perceptron is used to classify images from the MNIST database hand-written digit database using PyTorch.

The process will be broken down into the following steps:
- Load and visualize the data
- Define a neural network
- Train the model
- Evaluate the performance of our trained model on a test dataset!
